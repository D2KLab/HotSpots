1
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:14,927
It was less than a year after September 11,

2
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:16,602
and I was at the Chicago Tribune

3
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:18,476
writing about shootings and murders,

4
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,938
and it was leaving me feeling

5
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:21,720
pretty dark and depressed.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,302
I had done some activism in college,

7
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:24,949
so I decided to help a local group

8
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:27,658
hang door knockers against animal testing.

9
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:29,165
I thought it would be a safe way

10
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:31,047
to do something positive,

11
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:33,613
but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,

12
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,938
and we were all arrested.

13
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:38,150
Police took this blurry photo of me

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,376
holding leaflets as evidence.

15
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:43,240
My charges were dismissed,

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,376
but a few weeks later,

17
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:46,413
two FBI agents knocked on my door,

18
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,174
and they told me that unless I helped them

19
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,275
by spying on protest groups,

20
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:54,092
they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.

21
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:56,128
I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,

22
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:58,119
but I was terrified,

23
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,003
and when my fear subsided,

24
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,920
I became obsessed with finding out

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,037
how this happened,

26
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:05,215
how animal rights and environmental activists

27
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,429
who have never injured anyone

28
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:9,342
could become the FBI's number one

29
00:01:9,342 --> 00:01:12,546
domestic terrorism threat.

30
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:14,516
A few years later, I was invited to testify

31
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:17,020
before Congress about my reporting,

32
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,378
and I told lawmakers that, while everybody

33
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,103
is talking about going green,

34
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,641
some people are risking their lives

35
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:25,153
to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.

36
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:27,202
They're physically putting their bodies on the line

37
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:30,627
between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.

38
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:32,316
These are everyday people,

39
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,402
like these protesters in Italy

40
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:36,464
who spontaneously climbed over

41
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,765
barbed wire fences to rescue beagles

42
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,926
from animal testing.

43
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,602
And these movements have been incredibly effective

44
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,540
and popular,

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,401
so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,

46
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,965
eco-terrorist,

47
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,089
to shift how we view them.

48
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,976
They just made it up.

49
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:57,513
Now these companies have backed new laws

50
00:01:57,513 --> 00:02:00,252
like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,

51
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:02,371
which turns activism into terrorism

52
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,139
if it causes a loss of profits.

53
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:08,138
Now most people never even heard about this law,

54
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:10,264
including members of Congress.

55
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,175
Less than one percent were in the room

56
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,635
when it passed the House.

57
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,538
The rest were outside at a new memorial.

58
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,199
They were praising Dr. King

59
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,625
as his style of activism was branded as terrorism

60
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,276
if done in the name of animals or the environment.

61
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:28,213
Supporters say laws like this are needed

62
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,062
for the extremists:

63
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:33,011
the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.

64
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:35,273
But right now, companies like TransCanada

65
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:38,598
are briefing police in presentations like this one

66
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:41,287
about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters

67
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,425
as terrorists.

68
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:47,048
The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism

69
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,599
are not about violence,

70
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,312
they're about public relations.

71
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:53,285
Today, in multiple countries,

72
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,773
corporations are pushing new laws

73
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,487
that make it illegal to photograph

74
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:59,747
animal cruelty on their farms.

75
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:02,274
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,

76
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:04,047
and today we released a lawsuit

77
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:05,774
challenging it as unconstitutional

78
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:08,347
as a threat to journalism.

79
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:10,685
The first of these ag-gag prosecutions,

80
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,120
as they're called,

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,772
was a young woman named Amy Meyer,

82
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:15,385
and Amy saw a sick cow being moved

83
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,934
by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse

84
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,348
as she was on the public street.

85
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:22,559
And Amy did what any of us would:

86
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,334
She filmed it.

87
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:27,383
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it,

88
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:30,308
and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar

89
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:33,558
that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.

90
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:35,576
But apparently, even exposing stuff like that

91
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,396
is a threat.

92
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,060
Through the Freedom of Information Act,

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,920
I learned that the counter-terrorism unit

94
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,997
has been monitoring my articles

95
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:45,283
and speeches like this one.

96
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:47,509
They even included this nice
little write-up of my book.

97
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:50,624
They described it as \"compelling and well-written.\"

98
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:55,345
(Applause)

99
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:58,580
Blurb on the next book, right?

100
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,220
The point of all of this is to make us afraid,

101
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,109
but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith

102
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,940
in the power of education.

103
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:9,507
Our best weapon is sunlight.

104
00:04:9,507 --> 00:04:11,394
Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man

105
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:14,719
is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.

106
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,281
Over and over throughout history,

107
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,269
people in power have used fear

108
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,068
to silence the truth and to silence dissent.

109
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,107
It's time we strike a new note.

110
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:26,082
Thank you.

111
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:27,936
(Applause)
